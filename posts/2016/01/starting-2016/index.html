            <div class="post-content">
                <p>A quick introduction:</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited to start this blog, for a few reasons as you&rsquo;ll see, but I wanted to first preface this with saying: <strong>don&rsquo;t worry, this isn&rsquo;t just a &ldquo;New Year&rsquo;s Resolution Blog &trade;&rdquo;</strong>.</p>

<p>As some of you may know, I am currently in San Francisco, officially. I flew here on December 31, so I welcomed 2016 in my new, partially set up apartment. I moved out here for the time-being to pursue a <a href="https://hackbrightacademy.com/" target="_blank">Software Engineer Fellowship at Hackbright</a>. This is a pretty interesting time for me, in the last three days I&hellip;</p>

<ul>
<li>&hellip;got a local cellphone number</li>
<li>&hellip;visited my favorite tea place</li>
<li>&hellip;started spelling &ldquo;favorite&rdquo; without the &ldquo;u&rdquo;, apparently</li>
<li>&hellip;went for a jog in the rain</li>
<li>&hellip;climbed more hills than during the Tough Mudder</li>
<li>&hellip;rediscoved pennies and why we no longer have them in Canada</li>
<li>&hellip;set up this blog on Jekyll (<strong>!!!</strong>)</li>
</ul>

<p>So a pretty archetypal San Francisco/overall American experience. Amidst all of the frenzy of coming out here, I feel like I&rsquo;ve forgotten to thank the people around me who have supported me in this exciting new adventure (and by &ldquo;feel like I&rsquo;ve forgotten&rdquo;, I really mean &ldquo;I totally ignored all my wonderful family and friends&rdquo;). So, this post is, first and foremost, dedicated to them, the world&rsquo;s most fantastic people — I couldn&rsquo;t achieve anything without them.</p>

<p>Secondly, I want to say how excited I am for this fellowship (yes, this is turning out somewhat like an Oscar speech — <em>&ldquo;first, I&rsquo;d like to thank my family and friends&hellip;&rdquo;</em>). Seriously though, I am very much looking forward to the idea of immersing myself completely in coding and working towards becoming a software engineer. I have no idea what it&rsquo;s going to be exactly, but I do know that I&rsquo;ll be learning alongside some brilliant ladies and we&rsquo;re going to build cool stuff together — that alone is enough to get me all fired up and ready to go!</p>

<p>Lastly, I wanted to talk a little bit about the purpose of this blog and some of the things I hope to write about (a &ldquo;content strategy&rdquo; if you will, or a.k.a &ldquo;why you should care/read&rdquo;). The topics I&rsquo;m hoping to cover here will be roughly distributed as follows:</p>

<h3>Life Updates — 35%</h3>

<p>A good portion of you who are reading this blog (hi mom!) will likely be the said fantastic, supportive family and friends I&rsquo;ve dedicated this post to, so I&rsquo;d like this to be a way for me to let all of you know how I&rsquo;m doing as I trudge along (don&rsquo;t worry mom, I&rsquo;m still eating and breathing!).</p>

<h3>Thoughts on Technology — 25%</h3>

<p>Since, ultimately my goal is to become a software engineer, I&rsquo;ll have one or two thoughts about the world of technology from time-to-time. I hope to cherrypick the ones I find most compelling and share them with you. Feel free to discuss them with me and provide your critiques, I&rsquo;m here to learn as much as I can.</p>

<h3>Learning to Code — 25%</h3>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be doing a lot of that here, so I&rsquo;m definitely going to talk about it. I want to share some thoughts around coding and also learning code as an adult without a CS background. While on a broad level, the general pillars of success such as perserverence, resourcefulness, and grit still apply to learning code, I suspect there are more granular aspects unique to coding and there are likely some personal insights that can be gathered around those.</p>

<h3>Being a Millennial — 10%</h3>

<p>While there are already entire publications dedicated to this idea and this is not the primary highlight for this blog, as a member of this demographic, I will likely end up somehow sharing my quarter-life crisis, struggles with finding the &ldquo;bliss&rdquo; in my life, and other such &ldquo;coming-of-age&rdquo; highlights. I think that these are common themes that come up when reflecting, but I also understand there are already so many more credible explorations around these ideas and it may be a little tired for me to add to them. So I&rsquo;ll try to only throw my hat in the ring if I feel I have something worthwhile and of course, as always, feel free to critique.</p>

<h3>Food + Coffee — 4%</h3>

<p>Those who know me know I love to eat and drink coffee, so I will occassionally highlight some discoveries I make out here. If you have any suggestions for me, I&rsquo;m all for trying new things, so hit me! Or better yet, come along if you happen to be in the Bay Area!</p>

<h3>Future Directions — 1%</h3>

<p>I haven&rsquo;t even fully started this thing and I&rsquo;m already thinking future iterations (welcome to the world of Doria!). As I keep writing, I&rsquo;ll be keeping tabs on the way this blog evolves and speak to any significant shifts it might go through. I don&rsquo;t really foresee anything major in the near future, but it&rsquo;s definitely something I am keeping in the back of my mind. For now, I will focus on generating content and bringing in a comment system, so I can gather as much feedback as possible. Your thoughts will also help dictate my writing, so I really do appreciate any comments and feedback you might have!</p>

<p>Thank you for reading the inaugural post of my blog, cheers! &#127867;</p>
