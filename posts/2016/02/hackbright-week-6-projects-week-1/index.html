                <!--Introduction-->

<p>My original plan was to blog each day of this week, updating everyone on my project progress. As I started writing posts each day of this week, I found myself writing things like &ldquo;and then I scribbled lines on some graph paper to make wireframes. And then I did it again. And again&hellip;&rdquo;. While each moment was a riveting learning experience in itself and I will look back fondly at my simple self in a few months time, the message really boiled down to &ldquo;I did things that constituted working on my project&rdquo;. So instead, I decided to pull the scrum stand-ups from each day this week and highlight the main challenges and learning experiences. A wise Hack13right cohort mate said &ldquo;it&rsquo;s important for a developer&rsquo;s blog to have a message for your readers, it&rsquo;s not just a glorified Github&rdquo;, and she&rsquo;s right. Here are my scrum stand-ups from week 1:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Monday</strong>: Over the weekend, I finalized my data model and put together some rough wireframes. Today, I am working on the first iteration of model.py. No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Tuesday</strong>: Yesterday, I put together my first iteration of model.py and wireframes. I also met with a mentor to talk about my model.py, sockets and streaming for audio, and review my wireframes. Today, I will be hooking up my database to model.py today, testing it, then starting to plan out my routes. I will also be meeting with a mentor today to look over model.py. No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Wednesday</strong>: Yesterday, I got model.py and my database to talk to each other and work. I also set up some Flask routes that I will need to populate. I met up with a mentor and we worked through creating and logging a jukebox into my database (yay!). Today, I need to work on building out my templates and Flask routes. Also, Twilio field trip with the cohort, yay! No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Thursday</strong>: Yesterday, I built out the skeleton of my templates and hooked a route for creating guest users when they open up the public link for a jukebox. Today, I need to continue on this trajectory and set up a route for deleting jukeboxes, admins, and guests. No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Friday</strong>: Yesterday, I ran into some issues testing AJAX requests on deleting jukeboxes, admins, and guests. I resolved that issue by remembering a mentor told me to always test Javascript incognito to ensure my browser cache is always clear. The route now works. Today, I will be going off-site to a mentor office for lunch along with three other cohort mates and I will start work on search and adding songs to playlists. No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Saturday</strong>: Yesterday, I was a bit crunched for time between the off-site and study hall for class, so I just set up the route and had it submit properly. Today, I plan on continuing search and song add, then move onto votes if there is time. No blockers.</li>
<li><strong>Sunday</strong>: Yesterday, right after I said &ldquo;no blockers&rdquo;, I ran into a blocker. The Metadata API is discontinued for libspotify, so some test code I ran a couple of weeks or so back no longer do what they used to. I fixed the blocker by migrating the search portion of my project to the Spotify Web API. Today, I intend to complete song adding and also set up voting on the playlist. No blockers.</li>
</ul>

<p>To clarify, I don&rsquo;t actually have a scrum stand-up with myself out loud on the weekends, but I find myself making a little stand-up statement before I start working (once again, in my head, not out loud).</p>

<!--Accomplishments-->

<p>In terms of accomplishments this week, I&rsquo;d say &ldquo;getting started&rdquo;. None of the code I&rsquo;ve written this week is particularly challenging or far beyond the scope of our classroom (the Hackbright instructors do a great job of going over everything with us weeks 1-5), however, one of the biggest learning points has been &ldquo;getting my shit together&rdquo;. There are a lot of things that go into the planning stage but at the same time, it&rsquo;s hard not to get sucked up with project management and not start coding. Some ways that I&rsquo;ve stayed on top of this:</p>

<ul>
<li>I write code everyday. This is a software project so something needs to be built each day. While there is a lot of research to be done and things to be planned, there is always the potential to code something at every stage.</li>
<li>I keep a &ldquo;to-do 2x2&rdquo; instead of a &ldquo;to-do list&rdquo;. There is the unfortunate truth that life is constrained by time, so I plot all my to-do&rsquo;s on &ldquo;time needed to complete something&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;urgency&rdquo;. This helps optimize my time on things I need to finish each day, instead of finding myself trying to finish multiple unimportant (or even somewhat important) yet extremely time-consuming things. It also helps me make tough decisions when it comes to balancing what the right things are for me to complete in one day.</li>
<li>When I find myself asking the question &ldquo;what&rsquo;s happening right now?&rdquo; in the middle of doing something, I stop immediately. I don&rsquo;t have time to confuse myself. I usually consult either my to-do matrix or a relevant document to bring myself back on track (e.g. I&rsquo;m working on hooking up some routes this week, I&rsquo;ll check my wireframes or this chart of API endpoints I put together for reference).</li>
</ul>

<!--Things I struggled with-->

<p>As for things I&rsquo;ve struggled with this week, it&rsquo;s the idea of dealing with &ldquo;unknowns&rdquo;. There is no absolute, or rather, as logical thinkers, we &ldquo;know&rdquo; that there &ldquo;should&rdquo; be an optimal solution and we &ldquo;think&rdquo; we hold that solution. Going into this project, I tested the API&rsquo;s I wanted to use early and thought I &ldquo;knew roughly what was going to happen&rdquo;. Of course, I was very much incorrect, there is still a lot to learn and new and mysterious problems were constantly popping up (I&rsquo;m looking at you browser cache). When I found out that the Spotify Metadata API had been completely discontinued, I had to quickly learn how to migrate my previous work to the Spotify Web API. I am lucky that the team at Spotify had written a useful post on how the previous endpoints mapped to the Web API. However, I still had to take some time to figure everything out and read through the docs thoroughly, especially since this was a new experience for me. Coming out of week 1, this was a rewarding experiences for me and while I am frustrated it happened, I am also glad, because I had the opportunity to dig deeper into the technologies I am using for this project.</p>

<!--Closing remarks-->

<p>Lastly, some quick notes on the blog: if you are reading this from an iPhone 6 plus, no I have not fixed the footer issue. I will be looking into changing the layout soon, so these issues will hopefully be addressed with the full layout change.</p>

<p>As usual, thanks for reading and yay, projects! &#10024;</p>
