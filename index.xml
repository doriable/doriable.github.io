      <description>Hello, my name is Doria and I am a software developer working in infrastructure. I initially started my blog to share my experiences at a coding bootcamp back in 2016.</description>

      <description>The final full week of projects just flew past us and it&amp;rsquo;s been very stressful and exciting all at once! For those who don&amp;rsquo;t do well with suspense, I have figured out a way to stream music on the client-side (hurrah!). For those who have worked extensively with buffers, byte streams, Web Audio API and Python wave library are probably not all that impressed, but I am quite thrilled. There is now a bit of a wait time as the app processes the stream, but the client-side music playing is definitely worth it.</description>

      <description>This week felt slower and more frustrating than the other two weeks. Mostly because I felt like I invested a lot of time reading and going through documentation as I start hitting more complicated road blocks. Normally I would find this interesting and somewhat relaxing, but trying to go through large portions of complex materials quickly and efficiently in a limited amount of time was a little bit stressful. With that said, here are my stand-ups for Week 8:</description>

      <description>This is my Week 7 (week 2 of projects) wrap-up, starting with daily scrum stand-ups:
 Monday: Over the weekend I worked on route for searching and rendering results from Spotify Web API. Today, I am working to create a route for adding songs that have been returned from the search. No blockers. Tuesday: Yesterday, I put together the route for searching and adding songs. Today, I am working on rendering the playlist based on the songs I&amp;rsquo;ve added and setting up WebSockets for real-time playlist rendering.</description>

      <description>My original plan was to blog each day of this week, updating everyone on my project progress. As I started writing posts each day of this week, I found myself writing things like &amp;ldquo;and then I scribbled lines on some graph paper to make wireframes. And then I did it again. And again&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. While each moment was a riveting learning experience in itself and I will look back fondly at my simple self in a few months time, the message really boiled down to &amp;ldquo;I did things that constituted working on my project&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Happy Lunar New Year! üêµ Even though I was unable to celebrate it with my family in-person, I had the chance to Skype with them and wish them a happy new year.
It&amp;rsquo;s the end of week 5! Apologies on the late post this week, it&amp;rsquo;s been extremely hectic. We are about to start the second half of Hackbright: computer science topics and our personal projects, and I am both excited and anxious.</description>

      <description>As we cross the Week 4 finish line at Hackbright, we are also nearing the end of our metaphorical &amp;ldquo;80 days around the world of web development&amp;rdquo; (if only we actually got 80 days before we started our projects!).
This week was super exciting, although the contrast of SQL (which is awesome!) versus Javascript is a little bit of an emotional roller coaster for me. I have a working theory that Javascript is so widely-used because it popularized the mystique of programming and developers are trolls, thus wanting the general public to continue thinking that coding is &amp;ldquo;some magical shit that happens in a computer&amp;rdquo; without rhyme or reason.</description>

      <description>Week 3 down and wowit was a crazy week! I&amp;rsquo;m fairly certain my brain is just liquid sloshing around in my skull right now and I&amp;rsquo;m afraid to go to sleep in case it starts pouring out of my ears. This week, we covered an incredibly broad range of topics:
 HTML and CSS (Geocities and Angelfire flashbacks ‚Äî Hamster Dance, thisis all that&amp;rsquo;s left of you&amp;hellip;) How the web works (still tubes, wires, and magic ‚Äî but also requests and responses!</description>

      <description>Week 1 of Hackbright just wrapped up! Before digging into week 2 of Hackbright, I want to first observe a short moment of silence to honor the greatest head of house Slytherin has ever seen.
We covered a lot of ground this week at Hackbright, including the following:
 Collections: lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries Markov chains Twitter API Object-oriented programming More command line tools, including working with virtualenv  For me, week 2 had a real focus on expanding our understanding of developing software by bringing together all of these data structures and logical tools and getting our brains ticking on good &amp;ldquo;design&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>Week 1 of Hackbright just wrapped up!
Given that my first post was dedicated to my wonderful and supportive family and friends, this post is dedicated to the brilliant and fabulous Hack13right ladies I shared my first week with! It&amp;rsquo;s so interesting to see all the different backgrounds and unique personalities and it makes me more excited about the program by the day. We covered a lot of material in our first week, as well as some housekeeping stuff:</description>
